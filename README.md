# Environment Monitoring Arduino
Arduino project to monitor temperature, humidity, and distance using DHT22 and Ultrasonic sensor, displaying results on LCD.
## Project Overview
This Arduino project monitors the environment using a DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity, and an Ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement. The data is displayed on an LCD screen in real-time.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard

## How It Works
1. The DHT22 measures temperature and humidity.
2. The Ultrasonic sensor measures distance.
3. The Arduino reads the sensor data and updates the LCD display every second.
4. The data helps visualize environmental conditions in real-time.
