Arduino project to monitor temperature, humidity, and distance using DHT22 and Ultrasonic sensor, displaying results on LCD.
# Environment Monitoring Arduino

## About This Project
Hi! I built this Arduino project to monitor the environment around us. It uses a DHT22 sensor to track temperature and humidity, and an Ultrasonic sensor to measure distance. Everything is displayed on an LCD in real-time, so you can see what’s happening at a glance.

## Components I Used
- Arduino UNO
- DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard

## How It Works
1. The DHT22 reads temperature and humidity.
2. The Ultrasonic sensor checks the distance of nearby objects.
3. Arduino takes the readings and updates the LCD every second.
4. This helps visualize the environment in real-time, which can be really useful for projects like smart homes or climate experiments.
